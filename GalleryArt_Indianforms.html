<h3 style="color:White;font-family: TimesNewRoman;">Tanjore Painting</h3>
<p><h4 style="color:AntiqueWhite;font-family: TimesNewRoman;">Folk art is linked with the forgotten art of story telling.

Art forms of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Bengal narrate the myths and legends of local heroes and deities and construct a complex patterns of colours image of our glorious past and rich cultural heritage.

<h3 style="color:White;font-family: TimesNewRoman;">Madhubani Painting</h3>
<p><h4 style="color:AntiqueWhite;font-family: TimesNewRoman;">Madhubani painting, also referred to as Mithila Art (as it flourishes in the Mithila region of Bihar), is characterized by line drawings filled in by bright colours and contrasts or patterns. This style of painting has been traditionally done by the women of the region, though today men are also involved to meet the demand. These paintings are popular because of their tribal motifs and use of bright earthy colours. These paintings are done with mineral pigments prepared by the artists. The work is done on freshly plastered or a mud wall.</h4></p>

<h3 style="color:White;font-family: TimesNewRoman;">Warli Folk Painting</h3>
<p><h4 style="color:AntiqueWhite;font-family: TimesNewRoman;">Maharashtra is known for its Warli folk paintings. Warli is the name of the largest tribe found on the northern outskirts of Mumbai, in Western India. Despite being in such close proximity of the largest metropolis in India, Warli tribesmen shun all influences of modern urbanization. Warli Art was first discovered in the early seventies.Warli is the vivid expression of daily and social events of the Warli tribe of Maharashtra, used by them to embellish the walls of village houses. This was the only means of transmitting folklore to a populace not acquainted with the written word. This art form is simple in comparison to the vibrant paintings of Madhubani.</h4></p>

<p><h4 style="color:AntiqueWhite;font-family: TimesNewRoman;">Pattachitra style of painting is one of the oldest and most popular art forms of Odisha.

<h3 style="color:White;font-family: TimesNewRoman;">Rajasthani Miniature Painting</h3>
<p><h4 style="color:AntiqueWhite;font-family: TimesNewRoman;">The art of Miniature painting was introduced to the land of India by the Mughals, who brought the much-revealed art form from Persia. These artists, on their part, trained Indian artists who produced paintings in a new distinctive style, inspired by the royal and romantic lives of the Mughals. The particular miniature produced by Indian artists in their own style is known as Rajput or Rajasthani miniature.</h4></p>
